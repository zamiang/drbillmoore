To change up the way American Public Media thinks about and uses
social media, we worked closely with management to create a customized
two-day, hands-on workshop that taught existing staff how to create
social-first content, develop relationships with the audience, and
understand social voice and tone. This was followed up with a series
of weekly check-ins to provide ongoing feedback and recommendations
based on brand editorial and analytics.
