We've run social for Doctor Who on behalf of BBC America since 2011, cultivating an incredible fandom on <a href="http://http://doctorwho.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorwho_bbca">Twitter</a> and pioneering social television techniques like live-Tumblring. At the end of 2013, we rallied our community around the 50th anniversary episode to massive results. Thanks to months of participation campaigns, "The Day of the Doctor" ended up
being the biggest single-day television event on Tumblr ever: larger than the
VMAs, the Super Bowl, and the Grammys *combined*.
