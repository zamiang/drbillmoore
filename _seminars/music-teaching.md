This seminar provides specific strategies and exercises for integrating performance psychology into your studio classes and individual lessons. This session explores some of the differences between teaching for skill acquisition and coaching for skill performance. It provides a foundation for developing and executing mental performance skills necessary for playing your best when it counts. There is a clear distinction between the mental skills needed to ‘put it in’ during practice and those needed to ‘get it out’ during performance. Although mental skills make up just one part of the whole performance picture, they are often the part least understood and yet may be the most important in playing your best when it counts.
