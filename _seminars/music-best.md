This seminar provides a broader understanding of the psychological and emotional aspects of music performance. The role mental performance skills play in the execution of well-learned, complex, precise movement patterns will be discussed and strategies for developing the three mental performance skills will be demonstrated, specifically, 1) Courage: the ability to direct your will to overcome fear and self-doubt, 2) Trust: the ability to let go of your desire to consciously control correctness and 3) Acceptance: the ability to perceive outcomes “as is” without any judgement as to “good” or “bad.”
