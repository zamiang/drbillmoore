title: Coaching Mental Skills In Athletes
type: sports
---

This seminar provides specific strategies for integrating mental skills development into your coaching. It explores some of the differences between teaching for skill acquisition and coaching for skill performance. There is a clear distinction between the mental skills needed to ‘put it in’ during practice and those needed to ‘get it out’ during performance. Although mental skills make up just one part of the whole performance picture, they are often the part least understood and yet may be the most important in playing your best when it counts.
