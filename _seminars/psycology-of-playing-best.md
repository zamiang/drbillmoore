This session provides a broader understanding of the psychological and emotional aspects of athletic performance. The role mental skills play in the execution movement patterns will be discussed and strategies for developing mental performance skills will be demonstrated, specifically, 1) Courage: the ability to direct your will to overcome fear and self-doubt, 2) Trust: the ability to let go of your desire to consciously control correctness and 3) Acceptance: the ability to perceive outcomes without any judgement.
