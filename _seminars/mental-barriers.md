In today's high pressure performance environments, a thoughtful and integrated approach to the development and refinement of performance skills is necessary. Best performances occur when you are totally absorbed in and connected to the task-at-hand, free from expectations, fears, doubts and other cognitive activity. Self-doubt, fear of mistakes, over-analysis of technique, and heightened anxiety are examples of mental barriers to performing your best. This seminar provides an understanding of these barriers and practical strategies for overcoming them.
